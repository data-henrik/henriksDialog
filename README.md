### Manage dialogs for IBM Watson Dialog Service on Bluemix

This is a simple Python script I developed to manage my dialogs when testing the IBM Watson Dialog Service on Bluemix.
The script takes some command line arguments and then calls the related service API. The entire result is always dumped.

Some of the source is taken from this SDK example:
https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/python-sdk/blob/master/examples/dialog_v1.py

(More to come, first the code... ;)
